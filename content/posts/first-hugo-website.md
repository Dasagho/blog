Hi, in this blog I would like to talk about my journey in my personal projects and also about different topics that I enjoy.  

My main goal is gathering my thoughts about the difficulties that come my way and collect how I finally resolve them.  
As a second purpose I would say that, since long ago, when I found this express framework to generate web pages, it really drew my attention and now I don't regret it.  

This framework is really versatile. Above all, it surprises me the simplicity that I found since the start and the high complexity that it can reach if you dig into it.  

But I'm a total newbie after all and I have a long way to go. :)  

I will update this blog soon explaining my actual project. Until next time.
