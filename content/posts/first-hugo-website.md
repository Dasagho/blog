Hi in this blog I would like to talk about my journey in my personal projects, developing about different topics.  

My principal objective is group my thoughts about the difficulties that come my way and collect how finally I resolve.  
As a second purpouse I would say that since long time ago, when I found this framework expres for generate a web pages really drew my attention and now I don't regret it.  

This framework is really versatile, above all surprise me the simplicity at the start and the high complexity to which it can reach if you go dig into it.  

But I'm a really newbie after all and I have a long way to go. :)  

I will update soon this blog explaining my actual project. Until the next time
