# My first adventure with C++

Hi, in this post I will talk about my first contact with a more advanced C++ project beyond the little programs I made in college.  

I have to say that I was surprised in more than one aspect about the workflow. To begin with, I noticed the need of learning some extra support languages like Make or Cmake, which let me specify the rules and steps to compile the project. I apologize to the people who really know about the topic if I misspelled or I'm not very specific, but I wanted to write down my journey learning this language.   

To give some context, the project I'm doing requires a library in C++ to communicate with mail servers. At the company I work in they use [Vmime](https://github.com/kisli/vmime) to incorporate the communication between mail servers through SMTP, IMAP or POP3.
For several months some clients reported errors to use their accounts of a specific provider, the point is that this library is outdated, it doesn't receive updates since 2021...

For some reason, I have to assume the responsability of taking this deprecated project and modify it to incorporate the functionality we need. For the 3 months I've been working on this project, I can say that I felt a lot of frustation but learned a lot, more than in my whole life. 

Fortunately, I had all I was going to need: a huge experience navigating through code without proper documentation, a really great amount of time understanding mail protocols, authentication methods, and above of all, some excelent initial c++ lectures, with one of the best engineers I ever met as a teacher.  

And this is how my journey starts, here I will talk about how I want to contribute to this project. Meanwhile I will make my first contribution to the open source. I'm really excited.
