# My first adventure with C++

Hi in this post I will talk about my first contact with a C++ project more advanced, beyond little programs made in college.  

I have to say that I was surprised in more than one respect the workflow, to begin with, I noticed the need of learn some extra support languages like make or cmake, which let me specify the rules and steps to compile the project. I apologize for these people who really know about the topic if I misspelled or I'm not very specific, but I wanted to put in writing my journey learning this language.   

To give some context, I will start explaining the project I'm doing requires a library in C++, to communicate with mail servers. At the company they use [Vmime](https://github.com/kisli/vmime) to incorporate the communication between mail servers through SMTP, IMAP or POP3.
For several months some clients reported errors to user his accounts of a specific provider, the point, this library is deprecated, doesn't receive updates since 2021...

For some reasons, I have to assume the responsability of take this deprecated project and modify to incorporate the functionality we need. 3 months ago, on the way I can say that I felt a lot of frustation and I learned a lot, more than in my whole life. 

Fortunately I had all I will need, a huge expirience navigating through code without proper documentation, a really great amount of time understanding mail protocols, authentication methods, and above of all, some excelent initial c++ lectures, with one of the best engineer I never met as teacher.  

And this is how my journey starts, here I will talk about how I want contribute to this project, on the way I will make my first contribution to the open source. I'm really excited.
