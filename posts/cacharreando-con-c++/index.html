<a href=#my-first-adventure-with-c class=h-anchor aria-hidden=true>#</a></h1><p>Hi, in this post I will talk about my first contact with a more advanced C++ project beyond the little programs I made in college.</p><p>I have to say that I was surprised in more than one aspect about the workflow. To begin with, I noticed the need of learning some extra support languages like Make or Cmake, which let me specify the rules and steps to compile the project. I apologize to the people who really know about the topic if I misspelled or I&rsquo;m not very specific, but I wanted to write down my journey learning this language.</p><p>To give some context, the project I&rsquo;m doing requires a library in C++ to communicate with mail servers. At the company I work in they use <a href=https://github.com/kisli/vmime>Vmime</a> to incorporate the communication between mail servers through SMTP, IMAP or POP3.
For several months some clients reported errors to use their accounts of a specific provider, the point is that this library is outdated, it doesn&rsquo;t receive updates since 2021&mldr;</p><p>For some reason, I have to assume the responsability of taking this deprecated project and modify it to incorporate the functionality we need. For the 3 months I&rsquo;ve been working on this project, I can say that I felt a lot of frustation but learned a lot, more than in my whole life.</p><p>Fortunately, I had all I was going to need: a huge experience navigating through code without proper documentation, a really great amount of time understanding mail protocols, authentication methods, and above of all, some excelent initial c++ lectures, with one of the best engineers I ever met as a teacher.</p><p>And this is how my journey starts, here I will talk about how I want to contribute to this project. Meanwhile I will make my first contribution to the open source. I&rsquo;m really excited.</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button next"><a href=https://blog.dasagho.com/posts/first-hugo-website/><span class=button__text>First Hugo Website</span>
